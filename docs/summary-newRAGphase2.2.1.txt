WeeklyMemo Phase 2.2: CORS fix and UI interaction improvements

Phase 2.2 implementation includes critical bug fixes and user experience enhancements
for the WeeklyMemo feature, resolving CORS issues and MUI Stepper interaction problems.

## Bug Fix #1: CORS Configuration - PATCH Method Support

### Issue
WeeklyMemo update functionality failed due to missing PATCH method in CORS configuration.
When existing memos were edited, frontend would call PATCH API but server rejected
requests with "Method PATCH is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Methods" error.

### Root Cause
Server CORS configuration in server.js line 64 was missing "PATCH" method:
- New memos: Used POST method (worked)
- Existing memos: Used PATCH method (blocked by CORS)

### Solution
Updated CORS methods array in focus-app/server/server.js:
```javascript
// Before
methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"]

// After  
methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "PATCH", "OPTIONS"]
```

### Verification
- ✅ CORS Preflight: Access-Control-Allow-Methods includes PATCH
- ✅ PATCH requests: No longer blocked by CORS
- ✅ Authentication flow: Returns proper 401 errors (not CORS errors)

## Bug Fix #2: MUI Stepper Interaction - Step Expansion Control

### Issue
AI Draft and Final Memo steps in WeeklyMemo could not be clicked to expand/collapse.
Only Original Memo step responded to clicks properly.

### Root Cause
MUI Stepper component architecture misunderstanding:
- Used only `expandedSteps.has(index)` for content rendering
- Missing `expanded` prop on Step component for animation control
- StepContent requires both Step.expanded and conditional rendering

### Solution
Added expanded attribute to Step component in WeeklyMemo.jsx:
```javascript
// Before
<Step key={phase.key} completed={false}>

// After
<Step key={phase.key} completed={false} expanded={expandedSteps.has(index)}>
```

### Technical Implementation
Dual control mechanism required:
- `Step.expanded` → Controls StepContent expand/collapse animation
- `expandedSteps.has(index)` → Controls actual content rendering
- Both needed for complete functionality

### Results
- ✅ Original Memo: Continues working normally
- ✅ AI Draft: Now expands/collapses correctly on click
- ✅ Final Memo: Now expands/collapses correctly on click
- ✅ State sync: UI expansion state matches internal state

## Bug Fix #3: User Experience - Error Message Improvements

### Issue
Users received unclear technical error messages when WeeklyMemo feature was accessed
without proper AI Progress Analysis data.

### Solution
Enhanced error handling in three locations in WeeklyMemo.jsx:

1. **WeeklyMemoFab click handling**:
   ```javascript
   // Added friendly alert when no reportId
   alert('Please generate AI Progress Analysis first');
   ```

2. **loadMemos error handling**:
   ```javascript
   // Specific message for 404 errors
   if (error.response?.status === 404) {
     setError('Please generate AI Progress Analysis first');
   }
   ```

3. **Authentication error messages**:
   ```javascript
   // Unified English error messages
   alert('Authentication failed, please login again');
   alert('Please generate AI Progress Analysis first');
   alert(`Save failed: ${error.message}`);
   ```

### User Experience Improvements
- ✅ Clear guidance: Users know exactly what to do next
- ✅ Error categorization: Different error types handled appropriately  
- ✅ Language consistency: All error messages in English
- ✅ Actionable feedback: Users understand required actions

## Technical Details

### Modified Files
- `focus-app/server/server.js` - CORS configuration
- `focus-app/client/src/components/WeeklyMemo.jsx` - UI interactions and error handling

### Testing Verification
- Manual testing of all three memo phases
- CORS verification using curl commands
- Error scenario testing (missing reports, authentication)
- UI interaction testing across all stepper steps

### Impact
- Enhanced user experience with clear error guidance
- Resolved CORS blocking for memo updates
- Fixed MUI Stepper multi-step expansion capability
- Improved overall WeeklyMemo feature reliability

This phase 2.2 implementation completes the foundation for phase 2.3 Next Week Planning feature.
All existing functionality is stable and user-tested.
