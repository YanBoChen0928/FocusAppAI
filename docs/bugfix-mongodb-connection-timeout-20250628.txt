Fix: Improved MongoDB connection using event-driven approach

## Problem Analysis
- Production deployment experiencing "hn" errors (compressed AxiosError variable names)
- Root cause: `db.listCollections()` called before MongoDB connection fully established
- Error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'listCollections')"
- Frontend receiving timeout errors: "timeout of 10000ms exceeded"

## Root Cause
The original MongoDB connection logic executed database operations immediately after 
`mongoose.connect()` promise resolution, but the `db` object might not be fully 
initialized yet. This timing issue caused intermittent failures in production.

## Solution Implemented
Replaced Promise-based connection logic with event-driven approach using 
`mongoose.connection.once('open')` to ensure database operations only execute 
when the connection is fully established and the `db` object is guaranteed to be available.

## Technical Changes
### Modified Files:
- `focus-app/server/server.js` - Restructured MongoDB connection logic

### Key Improvements:
1. **Event-Driven Connection**: Use `mongoose.connection.once('open')` instead of Promise.then()
2. **Guaranteed DB Availability**: Operations only execute when connection is fully ready
3. **Simplified Logic**: Removed complex retry mechanisms in favor of timing correctness
4. **Proper Error Handling**: Added connection error and disconnection event handlers
5. **Cleaner Code**: More readable and maintainable connection flow

### Implementation Details:
```javascript
// Before: Promise-based (timing issues)
mongoose.connect().then(async () => {
  const db = mongoose.connection.db; // Might be undefined
  // Operations...
});

// After: Event-driven (guaranteed ready)
mongoose.connection.once('open', async () => {
  const db = mongoose.connection.db; // Always available
  // Operations...
});
```

## Benefits
- **Eliminates Race Conditions**: No more `db` undefined errors
- **Production Reliability**: Resolves intermittent connection failures
- **Standard Practice**: Follows Mongoose recommended patterns
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Cleaner, more predictable code flow
- **Better Error Visibility**: Clear separation of connection vs operation errors

## Impact
- Resolves production "hn" timeout errors
- Eliminates "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors
- Improves deployment reliability
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Reduces code complexity

## Testing
- Local development: No functional changes
- Production: Should eliminate MongoDB-related startup failures
- Error handling: Better separation of connection vs operation errors
