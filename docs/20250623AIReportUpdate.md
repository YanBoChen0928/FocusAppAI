Related Files:

- `focus-app/docs/AIFeedBack_RAG.md`: RAG strategy documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the behavior of the AI feedback popover in relation to the goal details section of the application, specifically for screen widths greater than 1101px.

## Popover Interaction
- The feedback popover is rendered when the user interacts with specific elements in the application.
- The popover is centered in the viewport using fixed positioning.
- The popover can ONLY be closed by clicking the X button in the top-right corner.
- Click-away behavior is disabled to prevent accidental closing.

## Layout Behavior
- The popover is centered in the viewport using transform: translate(-50%, -50%).
- For screens wider than 1101px:
  - Width is set to 50% of viewport width
  - Height is set to 70vh
  - Fixed position ensures consistent placement
  - Higher z-index (1300) ensures visibility

## Implementation Details
- The popover is implemented using MUI components, specifically `Popover`, `Card`, and `CardContent`.
- The popover's visibility is controlled by state variables that manage its anchor element and content.
- Positioning is achieved through:
  - position: fixed
  - top: 50%
  - left: 50%
  - transform: translate(-50%, -50%)
- Close button styling:
  - Prominent placement in top-right corner
  - Hover effects for better interaction
  - Clear visual feedback

## Future Considerations
- Monitor user interactions with the popover to assess its effectiveness and usability.
- Consider implementing additional features based on user feedback.
- Consider adding keyboard shortcuts for closing the popover (e.g., Esc key).
- Evaluate the need for different size presets based on content type.
