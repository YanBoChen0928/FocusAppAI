# AI Feedback Popover Behavior Update

## Overview
This document outlines the behavior of the AI feedback popover in relation to the goal details section of the application, specifically for screen widths greater than 1101px.

## Popover Interaction
- The feedback popover is rendered when the user interacts with specific elements in the application, particularly within the `AIFeedback.jsx` component.
- The popover is designed to provide additional information and insights related to the selected goal.

## Layout Behavior
- At screen widths of `min-width: 1101px`, the popover is expected to overlay the following element:
  - `#root > div > div > div.goal-details.MuiBox-root.css-14nuhdb > div.vision-section.MuiBox-root.css-m7d99a > div`
- This overlay behavior ensures that users can access detailed feedback without losing context of their current goal details.

## Implementation Details
- The popover is implemented using MUI components, specifically `Popover`, `Card`, and `CardContent`.
- The popover's visibility is controlled by state variables that manage its anchor element and content.
- The popover is styled to match the overall application theme, ensuring a cohesive user experience.

## Future Considerations
- Monitor user interactions with the popover to assess its effectiveness and usability.
- Consider implementing additional features based on user feedback to enhance the popover's functionality.
