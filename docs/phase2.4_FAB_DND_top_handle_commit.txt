feat: Phase 2.4 FAB DND Top Handle Optimization - Git Commit Summary

=================================================================
FEATURE: Optimize FAB drag handle design - single top handle
=================================================================

## Core Changes
- Replaced multiple side handles with single top handle
- Changed container layout from horizontal to vertical (flexDirection: 'column')
- Moved drag handle from FAB sides to container top
- Simplified drag handle count from 2-3 handles to 1 unified handle

## Technical Implementation
- Container Style: Added flexDirection: 'column', removed gap
- Handle Style: Resized from 12x40px to 80x8px (horizontal design)
- Handle Position: Top of container with marginBottom: '8px'
- Visual Indicator: Changed from vertical (4x16px) to horizontal (20x3px) line
- Event Binding: Single dragListeners binding on top handle only

## Layout Structure Changes
Before: [SecondaryFAB] [handle] [MainFAB] [handle] (horizontal)
After:  [TopHandle] (top)
        [SecondaryFAB] [MainFAB] (horizontal row below)

## User Experience Improvements
✅ More intuitive drag operation (top handle follows mobile UI patterns)
✅ Cleaner visual design (reduced UI elements)
✅ Larger drag target area (80px width vs 12px)
✅ Better separation of drag vs click areas
✅ Reduced accidental FAB triggers during drag

## Preserved Functionality
✅ Major FAB click → Opens WeeklyMemo dialog
✅ Minor FAB click → Toggles Next Week Plan expansion
✅ FAB hover effects → scale(1.05) and shadow animations
✅ Tooltip display → "Weekly Memo with Advanced AI Assistant" / "next move"
✅ Responsive design → All device compatibility maintained
✅ DND functionality → Position persistence and visual feedback
