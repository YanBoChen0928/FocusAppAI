feat: Implement dynamic FAB system for WeeklyMemo with expandable Next Week Plan

This commit introduces a dynamic Floating Action Button (FAB) system that 
intelligently displays Next Week Planning content based on availability.

## Key Changes:

### WeeklyMemo.jsx - WeeklyMemoFab Component Refactor
- Added `expanded` and `nextWeekContent` state management
- Implemented automatic expansion logic based on Next Week Planning content
- Restructured FAB container using unified Box wrapper
- Created dynamic text box that shows actual Next Week Plan content
- Added smooth animations and hover effects for better UX
- Implemented toggle functionality between expanded text box and collapsed icon

### Technical Implementation:
- **Auto State Management**: Automatically expands when content exists, 
  collapses to icon when no content
- **Dynamic Content Fetching**: Retrieves Next Week Planning content from 
  API and displays in expandable text box
- **Unified Container Design**: Both primary and secondary FABs wrapped in 
  single Box container for future DnD functionality
- **Responsive Interactions**: 
  - Expanded state: Click opens WeeklyMemo dialog
  - Collapsed state: Click expands to show content
- **Consistent Visual Design**: Unified border radius (16px), consistent 
  hover effects, and smooth transitions

### Design Principles Applied:
- Unified rounded corner design language
- Clear visual hierarchy (primary FAB larger, secondary smaller)
- Consistent animations and color differentiation
- Text truncation with ellipsis for long content
- Maximum width constraints to avoid layout interference

### Files Modified:
- focus-app/client/src/components/WeeklyMemo.jsx
- focus-app/docs/plan-implementation-fab_positioning_plan.md

### Future Enhancements:
- Container structure ready for drag-and-drop functionality
- Position persistence with localStorage
- Tooltip integration for better accessibility

This implementation provides an intelligent, context-aware FAB system that 
enhances user experience by showing relevant Next Week Planning content 
when available while maintaining clean UI when content is absent.
