feat: Complete Phase 1 MongoDB Integration - Fix AI Report Data Flow

## Summary
Successfully completed Phase 1 of Weekly Memo RAG implementation by correcting 
data query logic and establishing proper data flow from goals → reports collection.

## Phase 1 Completion Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- Database Schema Updates: ✅ Complete
- Data Query Logic Fix: ✅ Complete  
- Report Model Extension: ✅ Complete

## Files Modified
1. server/services/ReportService.js
2. server/models/Report.js

## Key Changes

### ReportService.js - Data Query Logic Correction
- REMOVED: Incorrect Progress.find() query (Progress collection has only 2 test records)
- ADDED: Correct Goal.dailyCards filtering for date range
- FIXED: Analysis calculation logic to handle taskCompletions and completed fields
- UPDATED: _preparePrompt method to generate detailed daily records summary
- REMOVED: Unused Progress model import

### Report.js - Model Extension for Weekly Memo
- ADDED: memos array field with three phases: originalMemo, aiDraft, finalMemo
- ADDED: Each memo contains: content, timestamp, optional 1536-dimension embedding
- ADDED: Vector index "memoEmbeddings" for similarity search on memos.embedding
- CONFIGURED: Validation for 1536-dimension embedding vectors

## Data Flow Correction
BEFORE: ReportService incorrectly queried empty Progress collection
AFTER:  ReportService correctly reads from Goal.dailyCards → generates reports → stores in Reports collection

## Technical Impact
- Daily checklist completion data now correctly sourced from Goal.dailyCards
- Task completion analysis includes both main tasks and sub-task completions
- Report generation ready for RAG enhancement in Phase 2
- Foundation established for Weekly Memo three-phase workflow

## Next Steps
- Phase 2: RAG Enhancement implementation
- Phase 3: UI/UX optimization for memo interface
